## Echor

This is an implementation of echo written in Rust for practice purposes.
The book Command-Line Rust from O'Reilly guided my practice,
but I took smaller steps and started from tests
differently than the book happens to.

As of this writing I think I'm about to move on to another exercise,
but might practice more testing on this project.
